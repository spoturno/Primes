# Primes
The goal of this project is to work with discreet math algorithms such as: primality tests, prime factorization, The Greatest common divisor, Prime-generating, Prime-counting, and more. Also, this will work as a library for other projects.

## Modules
### prime test
This module includes all the operation related to primality tests, the goal is to test these operations with big primes numbers and compare his execution times.
### gcd 
This module is in charge of returning the gratest common divisor.
### count
This modules includes all the operations realted to primality tests, the goal here is to test the effectiveness with big prime numbers.
### find primes
This module finds all the prime numbers between a and b where 0 < a < b all positive integers.
### utils
This module includes all the related operation about prime numbers that doesn't go in the previous modules, some are for example: prime factorization, euclidean's extended algorithm (Meaby could go on gcd), diophantine solution, and more.
